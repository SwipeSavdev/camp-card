        <h3>14.1 Informal Resolution</h3>

        <p>Before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceedings, you agree to first attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service ("Dispute") informally by contacting us at <a href="mailto:legal@swipesavvy.com">legal@swipesavvy.com</a>. You must include your name, account email, a detailed description of the Dispute, and the specific relief sought. We will attempt to resolve the Dispute within 60 days of receipt of your notice. If the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days, either party may proceed to arbitration as described below.</p>

        <h3>14.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>

        <p>If the Dispute cannot be resolved through the informal process described above, you and Swipe Savvy agree that the Dispute shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration administered by the <strong>American Arbitration Association ("AAA")</strong> in accordance with the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect, as modified by this section.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA rules</li>
            <li>The arbitration shall take place in the State of Texas, or at another location mutually agreed upon by the parties, or by telephone or video conference if the amount in controversy is less than $25,000</li>
            <li>The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws principles</li>
            <li>The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedies that would be available in a court of competent jurisdiction</li>
            <li>The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction</li>
            <li>Each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim was frivolous, in which case the losing party shall pay the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees</li>
            <li>If the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually agree on an alternative arbitration forum. If they cannot agree, either party may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>14.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>

        <div class="notice legal">
            <p><strong>YOU AND SWIPE SAVVY AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SWIPE SAVVY AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration agreement shall be null and void, and the Dispute shall be resolved exclusively in the courts described in Section 14.6.</p>

        <h3>14.4 Small Claims Exception</h3>

        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for Disputes within the jurisdictional limits of such court. If the Dispute is removed or transferred from small claims court, it shall be subject to binding arbitration as described above.</p>

Opting out does not affect any other provisions of these Terms.</p>

        <h3>14.6 Governing Law</h3>

        <p>These Terms and any Disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>State of Texas</strong>, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
